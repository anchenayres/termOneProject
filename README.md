<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->
### Project Description

Website users are not aware (or do not care) that the information displayed originates from a database. Users simply want to search, post, or order. Therefore, this term we were required to create an interactive web application to manage an inventory. We were required to use Typescript to create the MEAN Stack application to track and craft new items.  

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Angular] (https://angular.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. The [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) program will also be required.

### How to install

### Installation
Here are a couple of ways to clone this repo:

1. GitHub Desktop </br>
Enter `https://github.com/anchenayres/termOneProject.git` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

2. Clone Repository </br>
Run the following in the command-line to clone the project:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anchenayres/termOneProject.git
   ```
    Open `Software` and select `File | Open...` from the menu. Select cloned directory and press `Open` button

3. Install Dependencies </br>
Run the following in the command-line to install all the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install / npm i
   ```

4. An API key is not required

5. Ensure that Nodemon, Typescript, Angular and Mongo are installed as dependancies   </br>

6. Place "dev" in package.json and to start the back end run the following in your terminal (ensure that code is running on port 4200) </br>
   ```sh
   npm run dev 
   ```


<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->


### Inventory / Stock Page

The inventory section showcases all the items from the data in MongoDB. The user is able to switch between the inventory from each location (the origin of the coffee beans). The user is also able to add a new item to the inventory list, delete an item and uodate the amount for each item.


### Blend / Craft Page

This page alows users to blend new coffee combinations from two single origin coffee beans from the same location. In order to do this, there is a verification method to ensure that to ensure that this is indeed the user's web application and thereafter they are able to blend. Once a recipe has been blended the amount available will update in the database and will indicate whether there is enough ingredients (g) available for the specific blend.


### Location Page

It showcases all the items from the MongoDB filtered by their origins (locations). Users are able to view the information.


<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. For the conceptual process Pinterest was my best friend. I used this app to save all my ideas and explorations around specific UI Designs. I also watched YouTube videos of people creating various dashboards in javascript.

### Ideation
### Wireframes

As part of the ideation process, Figma helped the wireframing process as it was a crucial part to determining all the important information for the project and to ensure that everything is displayed in a creative yet functional manner.
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
#### Highlights

* I really enjoyed the complexity of this project, although I feel the project can be pushed further, I have done a lot and I am proud of the project as a whole. This project has definetly been my favorite project that I've done and I hope to improve it.
* Learning how to incorporate Angular with Typescript into this project was definitely a highlight.
#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* One of my largest challenges in this project was considering how all the required fields were going to be laid out, this was more of a front end issue.  
  
#### Above And Beyond
### Future Implementation

* Definitely focus on the frontend of the project.
* Incorporate a filter option for the inventory page and the location page.
* Use JWT authentication
