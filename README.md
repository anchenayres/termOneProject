### Project Description

In term 3 we had to create a mock ecommerce website which consisted of both client side functionality (front end) and server side functionality (back end)  with a specific niche towards the project. We made use of MERN stack with a specific focus on Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. 

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/)

### See all lastest and discounted products on this page! 

This page showcases a slider with an introduction of the Web store COLLAR CITY. Beneath the introduction is a Latest Products section and a Discounted Products section which provides the user with information regarding that product. Each product has a unique name which is the name of the dog showcasing the product in the imagery, it makes it easier to differentiate between the products.


### Feature 2

These are all the products available on this web store. They are all divided into sections depending on what type of product it is such as a Flat Collar or a Smart Collar.  Each product has a unique name which is the name of the dog showcasing the product in the imagery, it makes it easier to differentiate between the products. There is also a small description of the product with the price, enlarged view and how many of those items are in stock.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. For the conceptual process Pinterest was my best friend. I used this app to save all my ideas and explorations around specific UI Designs. I also watched YouTube videos of people creating various dashboards in javascript.

### Ideation

### Wireframes

### Custom UI

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* ETC.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Due to my project not working with regards to server-side  functionality, I would have to say there are not as many highlights as there were challenges. The overall look of the website was not that bad and did look aesthetically pleasing but it was definitely not the point of this brief. 


#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* This was an exceptionally difficult term for me personally. I struggled to keep up with the workload with other subjects and with all the errors I faced within this project definitely brought me down a bit.  The error which kept occurring within this project was [nodemon] app crashed,  and I was unable to load my products from Insomnia to MongoDB which really set me back. I did have a contact session in order to fix this issue as I wasn’t able to but as soon as it was fixed and I tried it on my own again, it did not work. This was also an issue which led to my server not opening up and then I wasn’t able to see what I was changing on my website. This was not at all the way I wanted this term to end but I will keep my head up and try even harder next term because this is a really enjoyable subject and If I just spend more time on fixing my mistakes and asking when help is needed, I will succeed.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* I would focus on my time management and spreading out my work load throughout the term instead of stressing about functionalities not working as they should last minute

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome
